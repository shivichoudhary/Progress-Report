Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I have explored Pygames and various examples of coded madlibs to see how I would like to structure my own project. I have started coding the basic body of text that will be used when filling in the blanks to then yield a fully finished paragraph.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I had spoken to my professor about possibly coding my madlibs to generate an image in the end when it is finally done, I'm not exactly sure how to do that yet so I'm still working on it. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have only encountered one problem and that is creating multiple text files to make them sync up. We have had a lot of practice with this so far, but some of the files don't work or yield an error and I must fix them before moving on.
